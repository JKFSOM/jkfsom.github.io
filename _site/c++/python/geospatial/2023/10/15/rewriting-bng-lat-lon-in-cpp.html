    <p>High-performance applications are often written in a lower-level language, such as C++ of Rust, rather than Python. This is common in the world of AI, where organisations including Tesla develop models in Python, and then rewrite them in C++ to improve performance. The primary allure of lower-level languages lies in their ability to provide finer control over system resources, thereby unlocking a significant boost in performance.</p>

<p>With a foundational understanding of C++, courtesy of my past engagement with microcontroller programming in C, the venture of elevating a basic Python package to C++ piqued my interest. As an Earth Science graduate, working in software engineering, it seemed fitting to work on something geospatial. In previous projects I’ve used <a href="https://github.com/fmalina/blocl-bnglatlon">fmalina/blocl-bnglatlon</a>, which converts British National Grid (OSBG 36) to lat-lon (WGS84). Whilst efficient, I suspected I could improve the performance of this package by reqwriting it in C++.</p>

<p>Aside from utilizing constants, not much has been altered in the code; it largely represents a straightforward translation to C++. The code’s available <a href="https://github.com/JKFSOM/bnglatlon-cpp">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>

<p>The following results were gathered over 100 runs.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Item</th>
      <th>CPU time (x 10^-4 seconds)</th>
      <th>Memory (MiB)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Duration:</strong> The duration for processing in C++ is significantly lower, showcasing <strong>a reduction of −91.15%</strong>. This reduction in time is a massive gain in performance, which is essential in high-performance applications.</li>
  <li><strong>Memory:</strong> The memory consumption is nearly identical between Python and C++, with a slight reduction in memory usage in the C++ implementation. This was expected.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>This exercise served as a valuable lesson in understanding the performance gains achievable when transitioning from a higher-level language like Python to a lower-level language such as C++. The drastic reduction in processing time reaffirms the importance of language choice in high-performance computing scenarios.</p>

<p>The code and the benchmarks clearly demonstrate the benefits of using a lower-level language for performance-critical tasks. For those looking to improve the performance of their applications, especially in the realm of AI or high-performance computing, transitioning to a lower-level language like C++ is definitely worth considering.</p>
